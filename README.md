# Welcome!

### My name is Ben Scruton, and I am a full stack software developer.

As a Ph.D. candidate, I built experience as a learner and as a creative thinker. Recently, I have decided to redirect these skills into software development. At the beginning of 2021, I enrolled in an intensive program at Coding Dojo, where I learned to build applications in a variety of languages, including JavaScript, Python, and Java.  I am excited to continue to learn and grow as a developer!

I also believe that technology can be used to make the world a better, safer, more equitable place. I am particularly interested in finding a way to use programming to help make a difference in people's everyday lives.

### Projects I have worked on include:

## Chess Roulette

A single-page application that allows users to play chess against one another in real time.  
Began development alongside a partner at Coding Dojo; since graduating, I have continued to develop the project and flesh out features on my own.

My contributions:  
- Connected React front-end to Express and Mongo back-end using Axios for a snappy user experience
- Created User and Game models with MongoDB and Mongoose, utilizing various data structures to store information in a way that can be converted into a visually recognizable chessboard on the front end
- Wrote all of my own move logic, using separate JavaScript modules for each piece to facilitate introduction of chess variants later in development
- Implemented bcrypt for password security and JSON Web Token to store user session information
- Added Socket.IO to communicate various information to all connected clients in real time, allowing play without page refreshes
- Styled with Bootstrap and custom CSS to balance visual consistency with functionality

## Dinner Getter

An app to find recipes based on ingredients users have, and to build and manage shopping lists with customizable categories.  
Began work as part of a team of four; I have continued development on my own, focusing primarily on expanding the functionality of the shopping list.

My contributions:  
- Along with team members, wrote back end using Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL to utilize relational database capabilities
- Along with team members, developed a React front end for fast load times, and styled with Materialize for clean aesthetics
- Introduced drag-and-drop functionality using [react-beautiful-dnd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-beautiful-dnd) to the shopping list, to allow users to reorganize lists easily
- Connected front and back ends via an API written with Java and Spring Boot, using Axios to streamline communication between the API and the front end
- Helped to integrate Auth0 third-party authentication for user convenience and security


## Bookshelf

An app to track and organize books using customizable ‚Äúshelves.‚Äù  Users can also add other users as friends, and then make book recommendations.  
Began work with a partner, who focused on the book and shelf side while I built the user profile, wall, and friend relationships.  I then stitched the two halves of the project together, and have since continued development.

- Implemented search functionality on various pages, including the ability to search for books as well as other users
- Used bcrypt hashing to secure user passwords
- Helped integrate Materialize styling into all pages
